            <ul class="report-text-spacing">
                <li>Writing the HTML code for our website taught us the importance of correctly structuring and tagging HTML elements,
                otherwise the page and its corresponding style sheet quickly become difficult to format. This was a steep learning curve
                but by the end, we were both happy with our ability to create a nicely-formatted, readable website.</li>
                <li>The EJS framework was adopted to deliver pages using partials as templates (i.e. the head, header, and footer sections). Prior to
                this, the code was repeated for every page which wasn't sustainable, or good practice. Now that the website contains 12 unique pages,
                we're glad we switched to templates early in the development process.</li>
                <li>The Bootstrap 4 framework has been implemented, giving access to its wide range of pre-built components and allowing seamless,
                responsive web-pages to be created.</li>
                <li>Bootstrap also allows elements to reformat depending on the window size to accommodate mobile and desktop users. This can be seen
                 in the navigation bar, the <a href="/learnhome" class="report-text-link">Learn - Home</a> page, and across the website - when
                 the window is resized the web pages remain readable and aesthetic</li>
                <li>All pages are delivered using the XHTML standard.</li>

            <ul class="report-text-spacing">
                <li>CSS selectors were used to personalise the style of the website, taking advantage of the
                  id and class tags to customise certain elements. Structuring the style sheet quickly became important because of how
                  many different tags were required, and so a sensible order and naming convention was used to make style.css readable. </li>
                <li>The Bootstrap 4 framework provided a significant amount of styling tools, allowing pages to quickly look aesthetic and professional
                 with a single selector. These selectors were then modified to customise elements of the website and create a consistent style.</li>
                 <li>Styling for different browser sizes was considered, especially on the learn pages, using responsive images and the Bootstrap
                 row/column system.</li>
                 <li> SVG line animation was added to the title and logo using CSS code. </li>

                <li>We spent considerable time writing a custom animation script (bubblesortanimation.js), adapting a quiz generation script which could be
                populated using the database, and several other customised animations to create a certain feel for the website.</li>
                <li>We have used the JavaScript anime.js and jQuery libraries for client-side animations, such as the section loading animation on this page.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript for each page has been separated to optimise loading time</li>
                <li>A custom login script was added for login/sign-up functionality on the navigation bar and the
                 login/sign-up pages. The input fields turn red when no information is entered, and key listeners were
                 added to allow form submission by pressing the Enter key, and to retrieve login/signup information</li>
                 <li>The JavaScript framework EJS (Embedded JavaScript) was used for page delivery and templating (see dynamic pages).</li>
                 <li>JavaScript is an area where we both feel we have learnt a considerable amount for both front and back-end applications,
                 especially given we had no previous experience using the language.</li>

                <li>We constructed several PNG images using a variety of tools in GIMP.</li>
                <li>To construct the placeholder images for the YouTube videos on the learn pages, we
                first downloaded the thumbnails for the relevant videos. This was imported into GIMP
                and then a YouTube play button icon with a transparent background was added as a
                new layer.</li>
                <li>To create the student and graph information icons in GIMP was a little trickier. We needed to
                overlay complex selections to get the shapes we required. Some of these selections were
                filled and some were transparent.</li>
                <li> Initially, a PNG image was created in InkScape and used for our logo, but as the website design evolved it no longer suited
                the aesthetic and so it was replaced with an SVG image which could be animated in a similar way to the title. </li>

                then by modifiying different aspects like gradient and stroke. The InkScape rendering was then combined and exported
                as an SVG with a single path - this was essential for the CSS animation we wanted to add to it.</li>
                <li>While the design isn't too complicated, this is the 5th iteration of both the logo and title designs
                and going through this process, we both feel that we have gained a lot of experience using InkScape.</li>
                <li>Implementing different CSS/JS animations across these various designs also improved our SVG knowledge.

                <li>Helmet.js was added to deal with URL validation. </li>
                <li>Began to set up a https server, however we were unable to get any further than self-certification. Unfortunately,
                when setting up remote hosting for our website, the self certification prevented this and so we had to remove it.</li>
                <li><a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/" class="report-text-link">Heroku</a> was used to host
                 our website remotely - <a href="https://pacific-brook-65939.herokuapp.com/" class="report-text-link">Click here to view</a>.</li>
                <li>Login functionality was added which redirected the user back to the page they were on upon login,
                and if they accessed a page which required logging in, they were redirected to the login page. Password hashing
                was also implemented to protect user data</li>

                <li>A server side SQLite3 database was setup, ready to use with dynamic pages and to store user information.
                A database schema was designed with constraints and foreign primary key interactions. The database was
                essential for our website as it populates the quiz information, leaderboards, account page information, and
                records and validates user logins.</li>
                <li>The database was also normalised, making it easy to query and insert/select data. This allowed
                more complicated queries to be completed, such as the joins required to display both the user data
                and their previous test attempts on the <a href = "/account" class="report-text-link">account page</a>.</li>
                <li>Checks were setup within the server to avoid SQL exceptions being flagged</li>

                <li>The EJS framework was implemented to dynamically deliver information to pages, allowing us to create
                page templates for the constant elements such as the header and footer.</li>
                <li>Tables were dynamically filled with scores for both the test leaderboards, and for users to see their
                personal previous attempts</li>
                <li>We both gained experience with sending and parsing JSON for use in partials.</li>
                <li>The website layout dynamically changed based on if a user was logged in or not, specifically the
                icons available in the navigation bar.</li>
                <li>Dynamic page delivery allowed us to simply create one quiz.js script which could work for every test
                page, because the script determines which page it's currently on and populates each quiz with the correct
                HTML.</li>
